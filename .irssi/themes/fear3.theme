		<pre># When testing changes, the easiest way to reload the theme is with /RELOAD.
# This reloads the configuration file too, so if you did any changes remember
# to /SAVE it first. Remember also that /SAVE overwrites the theme file with
# old data so keep backups :)

# TEMPLATES:

# The real text formats that irssi uses are the ones you can find with
# /FORMAT command. Back in the old days all the colors and texts were mixed
# up in those formats, and it was really hard to change the colors since you
# might have had to change them in tens of different places. So, then came
# this templating system.

# Now the /FORMATs don't have any colors in them, and they also have very
# little other styling. Most of the stuff you need to change is in this
# theme file. If you can't change something here, you can always go back
# to change the /FORMATs directly, they're also saved in these .theme files.

# So .. the templates. They're those {blahblah} parts you see all over the
# /FORMATs and here. Their usage is simply {name parameter1 parameter2}.
# When irssi sees this kind of text, it goes to find "name" from abstracts
# block below and sets "parameter1" into $0 and "parameter2" into $1 (you
# can have more parameters of course). Templates can have subtemplates.
# Here's a small example:
#   /FORMAT format hello {colorify {underline world}}
#   abstracts = { colorify = "%G$0-%n"; underline = "%U$0-%U"; }
# When irssi expands the templates in "format", the final string would be:
#   hello %G%Uworld%U%n
# ie. underlined bright green "world" text.
# and why "$0-", why not "$0"? $0 would only mean the first parameter,
# $0- means all the parameters. With {underline hello world} you'd really
# want to underline both of the words, not just the hello (and world would
# actually be removed entirely).

# COLORS:

# You can find definitions for the color format codes in docs/formats.txt.

# There's one difference here though. %n format. Normally it means the
# default color of the terminal (white mostly), but here it means the
# "reset color back to the one it was in higher template". For example
# if there was /FORMAT test %g{foo}bar, and foo = "%Y$0%n", irssi would
# print yellow "foo" (as set with %Y) but "bar" would be green, which was
# set at the beginning before the {foo} template. If there wasn't the %g
# at start, the normal behaviour of %n would occur. If you _really_ want
# to use the terminal's default color, use %N.
